# Face-Detector
# Description
The example code is in Python to detect faces using Haar Cascades.Object detection using haar cascades is a machine learning based approach proposed by  Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" in 2001.In this, a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images and is then used to detect objects in other images.
